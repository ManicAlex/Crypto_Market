## What is Crypto Market?

Crypto app is an easy solution to keeping up to date with the latest exchange rates and stock of the top 5 major crypto currency using the Alpha Vantage API [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). It also allows users to find the nearest banks using geolocation connecting to the google maps api [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) that is then displayed on Angular Maps [Angular Maps](https://angular-maps.com/) with markers on each bank in that area. 

In order to get the markers on the angular maps to work, a cors proxy is required and should be placed in a separate folder called cors_proxy in your htdocs.
